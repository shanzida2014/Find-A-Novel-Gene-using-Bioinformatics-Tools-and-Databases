-- This repository includes Word files and Powerpoint presentation on the Find-A-Novel Gene Project.Here,by using bioinformatics tools and databases I discovered a 
novel gene C24416 from A. japonicum.--It is a novel gene with a unique sequence, which was not discovered before.--However, extreme conservation of its CD225 domain with the characterized IFITM3 proteins suggest that C22416 might play IFITM3-like anti-viral 
and other cellular roles.--In addition, the phylogenetic position of CD24416 with other fishes and multiple sequence alignment suggest that IFITM3 proteins might evolved based on the needs of each species but kept the most important domain (CD225 domain) highly intact for functional conservation.--
However, further studies are needed to confirm if C24416 protein have similar role as IFITM3 and also it would be interesting to know if the gene could be induced by interferons in fish.
